**Breathe — AI Grounding Companion**

Breathe is a real-time grounding companion designed to gently interrupt moments of rumination, worry, or mental looping. The goal is calm regulation.

It works in tandem with the Omi device to listen to user speech, detect signs of anxious or repetitive thinking, and provide subtle, grounding nudges to help users return to the present moment.


Features:

- Real-time monitoring of user speech via Omi device → webhook → FastAPI.

- Message buffering with intelligent silence handling: clears old messages after inactivity.

- Sends helpful grounding techniques through notifications
