**Breathe — AI Grounding Companion**

Breathe is a real-time grounding companion designed to gently interrupt moments of rumination, worry, or mental looping. The goal is calm regulation, not therapy or analysis.

It works in tandem with the Omi device to listen to user speech, detect signs of anxious or repetitive thinking, and provide subtle, grounding nudges to help users return to the present moment.


The Idea:

Not therapy — never diagnose, analyze, or give advice.

Support, not solve — helps users regulate in the moment.

Time-sensitive nudges — interrupts only when beneficial.

Safe — no trauma digging, no CBT homework, no psychological explanations.


Features:

- Real-time monitoring of user speech via Omi device → webhook → FastAPI.

- Message buffering with intelligent silence handling: clears old messages after inactivity.

- Grounding detection:
